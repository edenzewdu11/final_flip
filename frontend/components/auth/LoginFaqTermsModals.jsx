Via App/Web: Go to Account Settings and select Unsubscribe. Via telebirr: Open the telebirr app, navigate to the FlipStar service page, and select 'Unsubscribe'. You will receive a confirmation SMS upon successful unsubscription." },
  { q: "What happens to my coins and progress if I unsubscribe?", a: "Your coins and digital assets remain valid for 30 days after unsubscription. If you re-subscribe within 30 days, your unexpired coins and progress are restored. Assets not recovered within 30 days will expire." },

  { q: "What can I do with coins?", a: "Gift creators with virtual gifts (Rose, Heart, Star, Teddy Bear, Diamond, Crown, Sports Car, or Rocket) — gifting converts your Coins into Points for the creator. Boost your content visibility, unlock extended video uploads (up to 90–120 seconds), level up, and unlock premium features." },
  { q: "What gift types are available and how many points does each give?", a: "All gifts give 1 Point per Coin spent. Rose: 10 Coins (max 500 Points/day to same creator).

Minimum cash-out threshold: 1,000 Points (80 ETB net after 20% commission)." },
  { q: "How does the score system work?", a: "Vote on a Flip: +1 Score to creator. Comment on a Flip: +2 Score to creator. Share a Flip: +5 Score to creator.

Monthly loyalty bonus achieved: +50 XP to yourself." },
  { q: "Can I cash out my coins?", a: "Coins earned through daily login bonuses and loyalty rewards (bonus coins) cannot be cashed out — they can only be spent within the platform. Points earned by creators from gifts received can be cashed out via telebirr. Minimum cash-out threshold: 1,000 Points (equivalent to 80 ETB net, after 20% platform commission)." },
  { q: "What is the platform commission?", a: "A 20% commission is applied to all gifting transaction payouts. For example: if a creator earns 1,000 Points from gifts, 200 Points (20%) are retained as platform commission, and the creator receives 800 Points (equivalent to 80 ETB) via telebirr." },
  { q: "Can I convert my Points back into Coins?", a: "Yes. The swap rate is 1 Point = 1 Coin. You can use earned Points to purchase more Coins for in-app spending instead of cashing out." },
  { q: "What is a Flip and how do I upload one?", a: "A Flip is a short video (15–120 seconds depending on your tier) or a photo that you upload to the platform. Tap the '+' button (mobile) or '+ New Flip' button (web), select or record your content, add a caption and hashtags, optionally link it to a campaign, and tap 'Post'." },

  { q: "How is my competition score calculated?", a: "Score = (Votes × 1) + (Comments × 2) + (Shares × 5) + (Gifts × 10). The user with the highest Engagement Score at the end of each competition period wins that tier." },
  { q: "Can I win multiple prizes?", a: "Yes, with rules. After winning a tier (e.g. Daily Sprint), you are ineligible to win that same tier again for 30 days but can still win other tiers. The Grand Final has a separate 6-month cooldown: if you win any Grand Final prize (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), you are ineligible to compete for any Grand Final prize for 6 months. You remain fully eligible for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly competitions during this period." },
  { q: "How do I claim my prize?", a: "Cash prizes (ETB): sent automatically via telebirr to your registered mobile number. Daily Data prizes: credited directly to your Ethio telecom account within 24 hours. Grand Final prizes: our team will contact you — you must present a valid National ID or passport. All prizes must be claimed within 30 days of notification. Unclaimed prizes are awarded to the next eligible runner-up." },
  { q: "Is there a daily limit on voting or gifting for one creator?", a: "Yes. Voting Cap: a single user can contribute a maximum of 5,000 Score Points (equivalent to 500 Coins) per day to any one specific creator's leaderboard score. Point Transfer Cap: up to 20,000 Points total can be transferred (gifted) to a single creator within a 24-hour rolling window. Total outbound cap: 44,500 Points per day across all creators." },
  { q: "Do boosted views count toward my leaderboard score?", a: "No. Views and impressions generated through paid content boosts do not count toward your organic Engagement Score. Only genuine, unboosted engagement contributes to your score." },
  { q: "Are there internet data charges for using FlipStar?", a: "Yes. Accessing FlipStar via the app or the web portal uses your regular Ethio telecom data plan. You are responsible for any data charges incurred." },
  { q: "Is my personal data safe?", a: "Yes. FlipStar is hosted exclusively on the Ethio telecom InfraCloud within Ethiopia — all your data stays in the country. Your phone number is stored in encrypted form and is never displayed publicly. All personal metadata (GPS, device info) is automatically removed from every Flip you upload before it is stored or published." },
  { q: "Can Ethio telecom change the Terms or cancel the service?", a: "Yes. Ethio telecom reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the FlipStar service or these Terms at any time, in accordance with applicable Ethiopian laws. Any changes will be published at https://flipstar.et." },

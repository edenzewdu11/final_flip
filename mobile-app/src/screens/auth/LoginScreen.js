    a: "Yes, with rules. After winning a tier (e.g. Daily Sprint), you are ineligible to win that same tier again for 30 days but can still win other tiers. The Grand Final has a separate 6-month cooldown: if you win any Grand Final prize (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), you are ineligible to compete for any Grand Final prize for 6 months. You remain fully eligible for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly competitions during this period."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I claim my prize?",

  },
  {
    q: "Do boosted views count toward my leaderboard score?",
    a: "No. Views and impressions generated through paid content boosts do not count toward your organic Engagement Score. Only genuine, unboosted engagement contributes to your score."
  },
  {
    q: "Are there internet data charges for using FlipStar?",
    a: "Yes. Accessing FlipStar via the app or the web portal uses your regular Ethio telecom data plan. You are responsible for any data charges incurred."
  },
  {
    q: "Is my personal data safe?",
    a: "Yes. FlipStar is hosted exclusively on the Ethio telecom InfraCloud within Ethiopia — all your data stays in the country. Your phone number is stored in encrypted form and is never displayed publicly. All personal metadata (GPS, device info) is automatically removed from every Flip you upload before it is stored or published."
  },
  {
    q: "Can Ethio telecom change the Terms or cancel the service?",
